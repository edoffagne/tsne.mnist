# A Shiny app to explore t-SNE representation of MNIST data 

## Introduction

This is a Shiny app that exposes a 3D representation of [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
data after dimensionality reduction with t-SNE. Under the hood, [plotly](https://plot.ly/) library is used to construct
an interactive graph.

A demo of the app is available [here](https://erikdf.shinyapps.io/tsne/).
